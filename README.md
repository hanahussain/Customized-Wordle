# Customized Wordle
Based on NYT game Wordle, with customized word list, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Purpose
This project utilizes HTML as a GUI for a customized Wordle game (titled Hanale), with the same functionality and animations as the original game with some customizations. 

### Files
Any words within "words-all.txt" may be entered as a valid word guess, but only words within "new-secret.txt" will be randomly selected as the actual word to be guessed. This allows for a customized list of secret words, not necessarily dictionary words, with allowance for digits.
